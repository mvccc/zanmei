# Hold ThouMy Hand

##
In all my need thy presence I would seek;
With earnest heart before thee I would speak;
I kneel to pray, O Father of us all,
And ask that thou wilt hear my pleading call.

##
Hold thou my hand, dear Lord,
Hold thou my hand;
I do not ask to see, or ask to understand;
Only that thou wilt be near, ever near to me,
Holding my hand, dear Lord,
Holding my hand.

##
My life goes on,
some days are good, some ill;
Abide with me, my heart thy presence fill.
O hold my close, O Father, lest I fall,
for thou art life and strength and all in all.

##
Hold thou my hand, dear Lord,
Hold thou my hand;
And when temptations come,
help me to firmly stand.
Near ever near to thee, all shall be well with me
Holding thy hand, dear Lord
Holding thy hand.
