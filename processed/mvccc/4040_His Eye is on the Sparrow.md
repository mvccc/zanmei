# His Eye is on the Sparrow(1)祂既看顧小麻雀

##
Why should I feel discouraged,
為何灰心常怨嘆
Whyshould the shadows come.
為何黑影瀰漫

##
Why should my heart be lonely,
為何心靈覺孤單
And long for heaven and home.
甚至欲脫塵寰

##
When Jesus is my portion,
耶穌是我的良友
Myconstant friend is He,
萬福賜我享受

##
His eye is on the sparrow,
祂既看顧小麻雀
And I know He watches me
深知我必蒙眷佑

##
I sing because I am happy.
我唱因我無憂
I sing because I’m free.
我唱因我得自由

##
His eye is on the sparrow,
我救主既看顧麻雀
And I know He watches me.
深知我必蒙眷佑

##
“Let not your heart be troubled,”
除去你心憂情
His tender word I hear.
我聽救主溫柔聲

##
And resting on His goodness,
安息主懷多恬靜
I lose my doubts and fears;
毫無疑懼戰驚

##
Though by the path Heleadeth,
有主引領在前頭
But one step I may see,
步步跟隨祂走

##
His eye is on the sparrow,
祂既看顧小麻雀
And I know He watches me
深知我必蒙眷佑

##
I sing because I am happy.
我唱因我無憂
I sing because I’m free.
我唱因我得自由

##
His eye is on the sparrow,
我救主既看顧麻雀
And I know He watches me.
深知我必蒙眷佑
