# Shall We Gather at the River召集眾人靠近江河

##
Shall we gather at the river,
召集眾人靠近江河
where bright angel feet have trod,
遍佈光輝天使足跡

##
with its crystal tide forever
水晶浪潮永遠湧溢
flowing by the throne of God?
河流源自主寶座

##
Yes, we’ll gather at the river,
召集眾人靠近江河
the beautiful, the beautiful river,
多美麗 極美麗的河

##
Gather with the saints at the river,
與眾聖徒相聚靠近江河
that flows by the throne of God.
河流源自主寶座

##
On the margin of the river,
江河邊岸蕩漾波浪
washing up its silver spray,
洗刷浪花閃耀銀光

##
we will walk and worship ever,
黃金日子充滿歡樂
all the happy golden day.
與主同在 永敬拜

##
Yes, we’ll gather at the river,
召集眾人靠近江河
the beautiful, the beautiful river,
多美麗 極美麗的河

##
gather with the saints at the river,
與眾聖徒相聚靠近江河
that flows by the throne of God.
河流源自主寶座

##
Ere we reach the shining river,
就近榮耀的江河
washing up its silver spray,
洗刷浪花閃耀銀光

##
grace our spirits will deliver,
靈魂蒙主拯救恩惠
and provide a robe and crown.
穿上白袍 戴冠冕

##
Soon we’ll reach the shining river,
快到榮耀的江河
soon our pilgrimage will cease,
我們旅途將完結

##
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
心中歡欣振奮歌唱
with the melody of peace.
最喜樂 平安音韻

##
Yes, we’ll gather at the river,
召集眾人靠近江河
the beautiful, the beautiful river,
多美麗 極美麗的河

##
gather with the saints at the river
與眾聖徒相聚靠近江河
that flows by the throne of God. (x2)
河流源自主寶座(x2)
