# I Give My Song

##
What can I give to
the babe in the manger?
What can I do to
show my love?

##
What can I give to
the One they call Jesus?
What can I bring?
What can I bring?

##
What can I give to
the Lord of creation?
What do I have
that’s worthy of him?

##
What can I bring to
the High Prince of heaven?
What can I bring?
What can I bring?

##
I can sing alleluia,
Lord, I adore you.
All my days I can sing your praise.
I can give my song to you.

##
He fills my mouth
with the joy of music,
he fills my heart
with the sounds of his love.

##
He fills my life
with the peace of his Spirit
Now I can sing,
now I can sing.

##
I can sing alleluia,
Lord, I adore you.
All my days I can sing your praise.
I can give my song to you,
I can give my song to you.
